# UNC Adapter

The Unidirectional Network Connector (UNC) Adapter connects [DeepLynx](https://github.com/idaholab/Deep-Lynx) and an isolated network environment, where the two systems do not reside on the same network. An example is a High Performance Computing environment without access to the network in which DeepLynx resides. The Adapter assumes a network environment where DeepLynx (presumably in a location like the cloud) cannot push to the isolated network, and therefore communication must be initiated from the side of the isolated network.  

The UNC Adapter queries DeepLynx for `tasks` of a certain type. These tasks are created by other applications. When the Adapter sees new tasks of this type with a `ready` status, it will collect these tasks, query DeepLynx for the data associated with the task, and then write a file with the retrieved data. This file is intended to be picked up by another process in the isolated network to be used as input for some job. The Adapter watches for a specified output file that will be generated by this other process, and then sends the data from that file to DeepLynx once found and set the associated task status to `completed`.

## Requirements

Python 3.6+ and the python [DeepLynx SDK](https://pypi.org/project/deep-lynx/)

## Getting Started
Copy `.env_sample` and rename the copy to `.env`, then fill out the environment variables. This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), use commands like `poetry install` and `poetry shell` to get started. Once dependencies have been installed, run from the command line via `python unc_adapter/main.py`.
